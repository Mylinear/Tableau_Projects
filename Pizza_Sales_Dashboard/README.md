# Pizza Sales Project

This project consists of two main parts: SQL and Tableau, aimed at analyzing pizza sales data. Part 1 involves setting up a database, importing data into it, writing SQL queries, and creating reports. In Part 2, we connect to the MS SQL server, process the data, and ultimately create a dashboard with a report using Tableau.

## Part 1: SQL

### Creating a Database

To set up the database for this project, follow these steps:

1. Install a relational database management system (RDBMS) like MSSQL.
2. Create a Database on SQL server.

### Importing Data

You can import the pizza sales data into the database using the following steps:

1. Download the dataset from [Data Source](https://github.com/Mylinear/Tableau_Projects/blob/main/Pizza_Sales_Dashboard/pizza_sales.csv) and save it as `pizza_sales_data.csv`.
2. Load the data into your database tables.

### Writing Queries

You can perform various SQL queries on the data to gain insights. Some example queries are included in the `Pizza_Sales_Dashboard/Pizza Sales Report.docx` file.

### Creating Reports

Generate reports from the SQL data using your preferred reporting tool or by executing the queries in the `Pizza_Sales_Dashboard/Pizza Sales Report.docx` file.

## Part 2: Tableau

### Connecting to MS SQL Server

In this section, we use Tableau to connect to the SQL database:

1. Open Tableau Desktop.
2. Connect to your MS SQL Server database using Tableau Connection.

### Data Processing

Once connected, you can perform data processing, cleaning, and transformations as needed for your analysis.

### Creating a Dashboard

Create a dashboard and reports in Tableau to visualize the pizza sales data. The details of the Tableau project can be found in the `tableau_project/pizza_sales_dashboard.twbx` file.
